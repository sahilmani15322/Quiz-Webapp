            <li><img src="cast/nd.jpg" height=190><em>Nina Dobrev</em> as Elena Gilbert (seasons 1-6; uncredited voiceover season 7; guest season 8), whom the series follows as she falls in love with Stefan, and later leaves him after leading everyone to believe he was her true love, for his brother, Damon Salvatore, creating a love triangle. This results in her being drawn into the supernatural world, with the show following her struggles in surviving supernatural events in the town. Dobrev also portrays Elena's doppelganger, Katerina Petrova also known as Katherine Pierce. Katherine sporadically appeared in subsequent seasons and played a significant role in the fifth season. Dobrev has also played the Original doppelganger, Silas' true love known as Amara during the fifth season, whom he sought in the afterlife for two thousand years. Dobrev also played another doppelganger Tatia in The Originals season 2 episode "Red Door." In the season 6 finale, Elena's life was tied to Bonnie's in such a way that as long as Bonnie is alive Elena will remain asleep. Damon put Elena in a coffin and had Tyler hide her in a warehouse in Brooklyn for the next 60 years or so while he waits to reunite with her. In the series finale Elena is awoken and she ends up choosing Damon in the series finale and they live a long and happy life together. Earning her happy ending.</li>
            <li><img src="cast/pw.jpg" height=190><em>Paul Wesley</em> as Stefan Salvatore, a good-hearted and affectionate vampire and the complete opposite of his older brother, Damon Salvatore. Later in the series, Stefan reverts to his old ways as a Ripper to save Damon from a werewolf bite and his role becomes more antagonistic, especially after he is forced to turn his humanity off. Eventually, he returns to his good-hearted and caring self and reconciles with Elena, but the relationship doesn't last long. He marries Caroline in Season 8 and is killed afterwards in the series finale as he sacrifices himself for Mystic Falls. Wesley also portrays his revealed doppelganger, Silas (seasons 4-5), the world's first immortal being. Wesley also played another doppelganger, Tom Avery, during the fifth season.</li>
            <li><img src="cast/is.jpg" height=190><em>Ian Somerhalder</em> as Damon Salvatore, the malevolent vampire brother who initially served as the show's anti-hero. He is mostly thought of as selfish and manipulative, but later on in the series, he begins to display a more caring side. Though his love for Elena is initially one-sided, she begins to develop feelings for him as they work together to save Stefan after he's given in to his ripper side. They begin dating in season 4, and continue to date (with some breakups along the way) until Elena is put into her deep sleep at the end of season 6. Damon is extremely close with Stefan, but also has a close relationship with Bonnie, despite the fact that they hated each other for the first 5 seasons of the series. Throughout seasons 6 and 7, their relationship has developed into a deeper bond, with Damon later confirming Bonnie is his best friend.</li>
            <li><img src="cast/srm.jpg" height=190><em>Steven R. McQueen</em> as Jeremy Gilbert (seasons 1-6; guest season 8), Elena's younger brother, later revealed to be her biological cousin and a member of The Five, a vampire hunter.

            <li><img src="cast/kg.jpg" height=190><em>Kat Graham</em> as Bonnie Bennett, Elena and Caroline's best friend and a very powerful witch, who has died numerous times during the show but always returned. She is often able to use her magic to help the group, and while she initially hates vampires, particularly Damon, she ends up warming up to them and becomes Damon's best friend after being stuck in a prison world with him for months. Bonnie has lost and regained her ability to do magic multiple times throughout the show. She spent seasons 1â€“4 in an on-again, off-again relationship with Elena's brother Jeremy and later became involved with Enzo.</li>
            <li><img src="cast/ck.jpg" height=190><em>Candice King</em> as Caroline Forbes, Bonnie and Elena's best friend, who was insecure and often jealous of Elena at first, but after becoming a vampire in the second season comes into her own. Neurotic but lovable, Caroline has been the love interest of many of the male characters. Initially serving as Damon's plaything in season 1, which she still hates him for, she has had serious relationships with Matt, Tyler, Alaric, and Stefan, and was long the subject of Klaus's adoration. She married Stefan before his death. Currently, she is raising twins with Alaric.</li>
            <li><img src="cast/zr.jpg" height=190><em>Zach Roerig</em> as Matt Donovan, Elena's childhood friend and ex-boyfriend, who became romantically involved with Caroline in season 1.

She appears to be dating Tyler but is more interested in Jeremy. She is turned into a vampire by Damon and is killed by Stefan shortly after.

His uncle Mason was also a werewolf, who was killed by Damon in season two. He was turned into the first successful hybrid by Klaus. In the season 5 finale, he is returned to being just a werewolf. He leaves town at the end of season 6, though he appears in a couple episodes of season 7, protecting Elena's coffin.</li>

Davis left the show at the end of season three after Alaric was killed. His character returned as a regular in season 6, after he was resurrected. Alaric is able to return to being a human with the help of Josette Laughlin (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) and the two begin dating. Jo becomes pregnant and they plan to marry, but she is murdered by Kai at their wedding. Jo's family of witches was able to transfer the babies to Caroline, however, so she gives birth to their twins, and Caroline and Alaric move to Dallas together.

            <li><img src="cast/mm.jpg" height=190>Michael Malarkey as Enzo St. John (seasons 6-8; recurring season 5), a vampire formerly under the imprisonment of the Augustine society. He was Damon Salvatore's cellmate back in the 1950s when the latter was captured by the Augustines. He and Damon revived their friendship as he searched for his lost lover, Maggie. In the episode "Man on Fire," Enzo shut off his humanity and then Stefan Salvatore ripped out his heart.
